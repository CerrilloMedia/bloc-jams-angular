### BlocJams - a journey into the AngularJS framework

The project assignment was to attach AngularJS to an existing JavaScript project with the same expectation. It was my first introduction to the framework and a necessary transition into my next path to learning Ruby on Rails. Looking back at this project it was a definite night and day difference when building it out from the original vanilla JavaScript [assignment](https://github.com/CerrilloMedia/bloc-jams).

| Goal as a developer |
| --- |
| Add AngularJS to an existing project |
| Configure routing and states for this application |
| Implement controllers for properly rendering views |
| Create a service for handling song playback |
| Write a directive which controls song and volume sliders |
| Include real-time time-code filters for displaying song length and current position |

This assignment/project required knowledge, setup and use of NodeJS, Grunt and Brackets.io.
